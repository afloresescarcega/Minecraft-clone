We consumed 1 slip day

We have attempted all the required features but landing. 
In landing, we have collision detection with the floor but not with collision detection walking sideways into another block. 

Extra credit attempted: 
"🎐 Draw a sky using a procedurally-generated texture (do not simply load a cubemap from file)." 
    - The clouds, which are part of the sky are generated procedurally.
"🔔 Implement the Day-night Cycle."
    - There are no keys mapped but the cycle is very fast. The sky changes color as well. A bright yellow sun is shown during the day. A white moon is shown when night.
"🔔 🎐 Implement View Frustum Culling in order to improve FPS."
    - Implemented in procedure_geometry.cc:28-91. The clouds VBOs are not updated to show the effect of the view frustum culling with respect to the initial look vector.
    - The terrain is always culled with respect to the look vector.
